# Clojure VSCode Environment

A remote container dev environment for Clojure in VSCode.

You can share this container across multiple projects if you:

- open this as a dev container
- clone/create new project into workspace
- run `code .` in the new workspace
- relaunch the new project directy via VSCode `Remote Explorer`.
